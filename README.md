# Supervised_ML_Chal12


This jupyter notebook will allow you to build a model that uses historical lending data to check how creditworthy a borrower is and see if they pose a credit risk.
<br />

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the jupyter notebook
<br />

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.<br />

 pip install pandas<br />
 pip install sklearn<br />
 pip install imblearn<br />
<br />
 import numpy<br />
 import pandas<br />
 import Path<br />
 import balanced_accuracy_score<br />
 import confusion_matrix<br />
 import classifiation_report_imbalanced<br />
 <br />

## Findings/Analysis 
For this data analysis I first separated the given data into labels and features using X and y. This data was then trained, fit, and modeled. All the results were then given an accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report. This was also repeated using resampled data (oversampling).
